# Advancing Tool-Augmented Large Language Models via Meta-Verification and Reflection Learning

This repository contains the implementation of our KDD '25 paper "Advancing Tool-Augmented Large Language Models via Meta-Verification and Reflection Learning". The paper presents Tool-MVR, a novel approach to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) with comprehensive System 2 reasoning capabilities by introducing Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) for high-quality instruction data and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) for robust error correction.

- The `data` folder contains the partial data for RefineToolBench, including partial training data (ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R) and some output examples.
- The `stabletoolbench` folder contains the agent inference code and server operation code.
- The `.py` files in the main folder include code for data processing and evaluation.
- The `.sh` files contain scripts for inference.
