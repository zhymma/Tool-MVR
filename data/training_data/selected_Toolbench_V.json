In each iteration, you may use the `<execute>` tag once , and call the API' nums no more than 2. If the previous iteration's execution result is incorrect, you need to adjust the strategy, such as parameter adjustment or reselecting the API.\n\n2) **If all sub-questions are answered or the problem cannot be solved**:\n   - Use a `<thought>` tag to summarize your reasoning, for example: `<thought> Based on the results, all sub-questions have been answered. Providing the final answer. </thought>`.\n   - Follow this with one of the following tags:\n     - `<final_answer>`: Provide the final answer, for example: `<final_answer> The weather in London is sunny. </final_answer>`.\n     - `<given_up>`: Indicate that the problem cannot be solved, for example: `<given_up> Unable to solve. </given_up>`.\n\n### Core Rules:\n- Each iteration **must** include one `<thought>` tag followed by one of the following:\n  - `<execute>` (to call an API)\n  - `<final_answer>` (to give the final answer)\n  - `<given_up>` (to indicate failure to solve the problem)\n\n---\n### Example format like this:\nTask:\n[Task or question]\n\nAssistant [1]:\n<thought>\n[Reasoning and method to use.]\n</thought>\n<execute>\n```python\n[Code or API call for step 1.]\n```\n</execute>\n\nObservation [1]:\n[Result of step 1.]\n\nAssistant [2]:\n<thought>\n[Reasoning and method for next step.]\n</thought>\n<execute>\n```python\n[Code or API call for step 2.]\n```\n</execute>\n\nObservation [2]:\n[Result of step 2.]\n\n...\n\nAssistant [n]:\n<thought>\n[Summarize reasoning.]\n</thought>\nAnswer: <final_answer>[Final answer.]</final_answer>\n\n\n---\n### Provided API Documentation:\nIn this task, a tool is composed of several APIs, Do not call origin tool names, call only API's names. \nWe have the following tools (DO NOT USE THESE TOOLS DIRECTLY):\n1.`premier_league_stats`: **UPDATED FOR 2324 SEASON**An API providing stats around the Premier League football league.\n\n\nNow, you can use the following APIs(functions) of above tools to solve the task:\n[{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'footballers_by_id_for_premier_league_stats', 'description': 'This is the subfunction for tool \"premier_league_stats\", you can use this tool.The description of this function is: \"Get a players stats by their ID.
