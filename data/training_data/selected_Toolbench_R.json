Instead, I mistakenly selected the `sponge_bob_for_memeados` API, which generates a Sponge Bob meme. Choosing this API was incorrect because the task clearly specified the use of the \"Drake Likes and Hates\" meme style.\n\nTo correct this:\n1. I need to use the `drakelikehate_for_memeados` API, which is specifically designed to generate a Drake meme with separate text inputs for the \"Likes\" and \"Hates\" panels.\n2. I will input 'Unconditional love' for the disliked panel (`text1`) and 'Endless laughter' for the liked panel (`text2`), as per the request.\n\nI will now reattempt using the correct API with accurately set parameters.\n</thought>\n<execute>\n```python\nprint(drakelikehate_for_memeados(text1=\"Unconditional love\", text2=\"Endless laughter\"))\n```\n</execute>",
